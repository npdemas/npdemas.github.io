My name is Nickolas P. Demas and I am a maker, inventor, engineer, and entrepreneur. I love tackling multidisciplinary challenges with top-notch collaborators. In particular, I am drawn to seeking solutions that make people's lives longer, happier, and more productive.

Having studied Mechanical Engineering through my academic training, I received my BS from Yale College and my SM and PhD from MIT. My expertise is in mechatronics systems, mechanical/product design, and manufacturing. I am particularly seasoned in the development of advanced instrumentation and medical devices.
