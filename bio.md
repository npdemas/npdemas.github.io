My name is Nickolas Demas and I am an engineer entrepreneur. I am a maker, inventor, engineer and designer, and I love tackling new, multidisciplinary challenges to help people live longer, happier, and more productive lives. My areas of technical expertise are in mechatronics systems and manufacturing with an emphasis on advanced sensing systems and medical devices, and I'm a fast learner and love hands-on problem solving.
