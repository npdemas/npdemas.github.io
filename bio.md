My name is Nickolas Demas and I am a maker, inventor, engineer and entrepreneur. I love tackling new, multidisciplinary challenges to help people live longer, happier, and more productive lives. 

I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering from Yale College and completed my SM and PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My areas of technical expertise are in mechatronics systems and manufacturing with an emphasis on advanced sensing systems and medical devices. I also have experience with startups (both as a team member and founder). In addition, I'm a flexible and fast learner and I love hands-on problem solving.
