My name is Nickolas Demas and I am an engineer entrepreneur. I am a maker, inventor, engineer and designer, and I love tackling new, multidisciplinary challenges to help people live longer, happier, and more productive lives. My areas of technical expertise are in mechatronics systems and manufacturing with an emphasis on advanced sensing systems and medical devices. With that said, I'm a flexible and fast learner that loves hands-on problem solving.
